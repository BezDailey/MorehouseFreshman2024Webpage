                    <h3>Stuart Hall</h3>
                    <p>A detonating cap assembly is provided with a fuse-retaining bushing for protecting the charge within the cap from accidental ignition by static charges accumulating on the fuse. The bushing is an elongated semi-conductive plastic member slidably received within the shell of the cap and having a longitudinally extending axial bore for receiving the fuse and providing a stand-off from the charge within the cap. The bushing incorporates a thin rupturable membrane at its innermost end within the stand-off and a side notch adjacent the membrane forming a shunt path extending laterally outwardly from the bore toward said shell for diverting static charge from the fuse toward the shell of the cap.</p>

                    <h2>Beloved</h2>
                    <h3>Toni Morrison</h3>
                    <p>Staring unflinchingly into the abyss of slavery, this spellbinding novel transforms history into a story as powerful as Exodus and as intimate as a lullaby. Sethe, its protagonist, was born a slave and escaped to Ohio, but eighteen years later she is still not free. She has too many memories of Sweet Home, the beautiful farm where so many hideous things happened. And Sethe's new home is haunted by the ghost of her baby, who died nameless and whose tombstone is engraved with a single word: Beloved. Filled with bitter poetry and suspense as taut as a rope, Beloved""is a towering achievement.</p>

                    <h2>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</h2>
                    <h3>Maya Angelou</h3>
                    <p>Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local "powhitetrash." At eight years old and back at her mother's side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age-and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns about love for herself and the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors ("I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare") will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned.
                    Poetic and powerful, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a modern American classic that will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read.</p>

                    <h2>The Souls of Black Folk</h2>
                    <h3>W. E. B. Du Bois</h3>
                    <p>The book contains several essays on race, some of which had been published earlier in The Atlantic Monthly. To develop this work, Du Bois drew from his own experiences as an African American in American society. Outside of its notable relevance in African-American history, The Souls of Black Folk also holds an important place in social science as one of the early works in the field of sociology.</p>

                    <h2>History of Morehouse College</h2>
                    <h3>Benjamin Brawley</h3>
                    <p>Founded only two years after the end of the Civil War, Atlanta's Morehouse College to this day remains one of the few traditional men's colleges in the United States. Originally dedicated to an all-black student body that was focused on studying the ministry and education, today the school welcomes students of all races to a full range of liberal-arts studies. The extraordinary history of the school was first explored in 1917's *History of Morehouse College,* written by the then-dean of the college. From its founding and early presidents to the roster of illustrious alumni and their work through the early years of the 20th century, this is an important document of African-American history, and includes the school's original charter and lists of students and graduates from 1871 through 1916.</p>

                <p>Dr. David A. Thomas became the 12th president of Morehouse College upon his installation in January 2018. The Board of Trustees selected Thomas for many reasons, including his visionary leadership as an Ivy League business school administrator and a proven track record as a fundraiser.</p>
